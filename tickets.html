      <p class="ticket-description">We believe that information and access to it should be open, free and shared. The Open Access ticket program is an embodiment of that notion. Open Access tickets get you the same exact conference experience as the “Answer to Everything” ticket, but you get it all for absolutely no cost. These tickets operate like a “take-a-number” line at the deli counter. Any attendee is welcomed to request an Open Access ticket for any reason, no questions asked. Upon making your request, if there have been Open Access donations by other conference attendee’s, you will receive a ticket at no cost! If there are no funds in the donor pool, then you will until a donation is made. If not enough donations come in, prior to the conference, you will be given an opportunity to purchase at the door.</p>

      <p class="ticket-description">If you happen to believe that access to information (and especially Open Sourced information!) should be free, then here is your chance to help us enable that to happen at this very conference. For every donation of $42, or more to CPOSC, we’ll grant access to a person who couldn’t otherwise attend. These donations make it possible to offer our Open Access ticket initiative, as well as our free and discounted student ticket programs.</p>
